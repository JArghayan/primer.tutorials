## Introduction
### 

## kable
### 

The **knitr** package "provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R using [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) techniques."  `kable()` is a function in **knitr** for [making tables](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

By the end of this section you will create a table that looks like this:

```{r}
kable_t <- nominate %>% 
  #This data was chosen arbitrarily to create a decently sized table 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select(name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"),
        align = "l", 
        caption = "Sample of Nominate Data of Senate Members from the First Congress")

kable_t
```

### Exercise 1

Load the **knitr** library.

```{r kable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

### 

### Exercise 2

We will use the data in `nominate` in this section. Run `glimpse()` on `nominate` to learn about the variables.

```{r kable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(nominate) 
```

### 

`nominate` is a data set that provides information on Congressional roll call votes in the United States from the first U.S. Congress in 1789 to the `r max(nominate$congress)`th  Congress.

### Exercise 3

Continue the pipe with `arrange()` to sort the data set alphabetically by `name`

```{r kable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

`nominate` includes votes from the Senate, the President of the United States, and the House of Representatives.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe and `filter()` the data to show only observations where `congress == 1`, `party == "Anti-Administration"`and `chamber == "Senate"`.

```{r kable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
filter(congress == ..., chamber = "...")
```

### 

`nominate` includes indicators of politicians' ideological positions, which have been estimated using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)}{NOMINATE}.

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `name`, `born`, `died`, `state`, `nominate_dim1`, `nominate_dim2` columns.

```{r kable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(...)
```

### 

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `kable()` to create a table.

```{r kable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable()
```

### 

The output should look like this:

```{r}
nominate %>% 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select( name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `kable()`, assign c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters")` to 'col.names'

<!-- Make this question more clear -->

```{r kable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"))
```

### Exercise 8

Add another argument to `kable()` that assigns "l" to `align`. This will left-align the data.

```{r kable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(...,
        align = "l")
```

### 

You can assign "c" or "r" to `align` if you want to center-align or right-align the data.

### 

You can individually align specific columns using a list

### 

Your table should now be identical to the one we are aiming to make. Good job!

```{r}
kable_t
```

### 

Note that we are unable to create a good title, cite our source, or easily customize our table even further.

You can create a caption by assigning a string to the caption variable within `kable()`

While kable allows the creation of tables, customization of tables is limited when using this package. Instead we can use a different package that better suits our needs.



## gt
### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Dragon-Ball-GT.jpeg")
```

It is time to learn about **gt**

### 

Nope not Dragon Ball GT.

### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Ford-GT.jpeg")
```

### 

Not the Ford GT either. 

### 

The **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** we will learn about is even better than those other ones. Using **gt** you will be able to create better tables. 

### Exercise 1

Load the **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** library.

```{r gt-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be [used](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/) to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/) this package. 


### Exercise 2

Run `?gt` on the next line to get more information about the `gt( )` function. This will give you an idea of what you need to make best use of this function.

```{r gt-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?gt
```

### 

Some other packages we can use to create tables are **gt**, **reactable**, **DT**, **formattable**, and **flextable**.

### 

Now let's make a table! the table we will make will end up looking like this:

```{r}
gt_t <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Observations of Enos Data Sample**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
    tab_source_note("Enos (2014)") %>%
    fmt_currency(columns = c(income), 
                 decimals = 0) 
gt_t
```

### 

The data set that will be used to make this table is the `trains` data set which can be found in **primer.data**.

### Exercise 3

Print the `trains` data set


```{r gt-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains
```

### 

This shows us the first 10 rows of the data set. At this point we do not know what any of the data means.

### Exercise 4

Look up the help page with `?trains`.

```{r gt-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains
```

### 

`?trains` isn't the only way to get more information about a data set. Some other functions are `glimpse(trains)`,  `summary(trains)`, `skim(trains)`, and `View(trains)`. 

### Exercise 5

Start a pipe with the `trains` data set. `select()` the `gender`, `income`, and `att_end` columns.

```{r gt-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

`trains` is a data set that shows individuals' attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after an experiment which randomly exposed a treated group to Spanish-speakers on a Boston commuter train platform.

### Exercise 6

Add `slice()` to the pipe so that only the first 5 rows are displayed

```{r gt-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  slice(...:...)
```

### 

### Exercise 7

Continue your pipe with `gt()`.

```{r gt-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

Your output should look like this:

```{r}
trains %>% 
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

We now have a functional table. Let's make it look like the table we are aiming to make.

A reminder on how that table looks:

```{r}
gt_t
```

### Exercise 8

Add a `title` and `subtitle` to the table by using `tab_header()`.
```{r gt-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "...",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:
```{r}
trains %>%
    select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
slice(1:5) %>% 
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Enos Data Observations", 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

### 

Notice how the title is not bold like it is in the table we want to recreate.

### Exercise 9

By default, titles and other text can not be formatted. To format them, wrap the character string in a call to md().

```{r gt-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**...**"),
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Change the column names using cols_label()
```{r gt-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(... = "...",
             ... = "...",
             ... = "...")
```

### Exercise 11

Add a caption/cite your source using tab_source_note()

```{r gt-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note("...")
```

### Exercise 12

Part of the caption should be italicized. This can be done by wrapping the character string in a call to md()

```{r gt-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("..., *...*"))
```

### Exercise 13

Add dollar signs and commas to the income column using fmt_currency() (if you only want commas, you can use fmt_number()). Put income within c() to indicate that income is a currency, and assign a value of 0 to the decimals argument. Make sure that your table looks like the table we are aiming to make.

```{r gt-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  fmt_currency(c(...), decimals = ...)
```

Remember, your final table should look like

```{r}
gt_t
```

## nhanes
### 

Let's make a new table using a different data set to make sure we understand how to effectively use `gt`

### 

The table we will be making will look like this:

```{r}
nhanes_t <- nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age > 40, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Relationship between Household Income, Sleep and General Health in Mexican Women who are over 40 years old**"),
             subtitle = "Those who make over 75,000 seem to have the best General Health") %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = "Household Income",
             age = "Age",
             sleep = "Sleep (in hours)",
             general_health = "General Health") %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011*")) %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "General Health is ranked on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is \"poor\" health, 2 is \"fair\", 3 is \"good\", 4 is \"very good\", and 5 is \"excellent\".", locations = cells_body(column = general_health))
nhanes_t
```

### Exercise 1

Run `nhanes` to load in the data set.

```{r nhanes-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes
```

### 

We don't know what any of this data is yet.

### Exercise 2

Run `?nhanes` data set to get more information about it.

```{r nhanes-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?nhanes
```

### 

From this we learn that `nhanes` contains data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) research survey. The survey examines health and nutritional status nationwide.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with `nhanes`. Continue the pipe to `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `year` is `2011`, `gender` is `"Female"`, `age` is greater than `40`, and `race` is `"Mexican"`.

```{r nhanes-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == ..., gender == "...", age > ..., race == "...")
```

### 

These restrictions were chosen arbitrarily so that our end table is of manageable size.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with `drop_na()` to drop all the rows with any missing values

```{r nhanes-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  drop_na()
```

### 

`nhanes` is a unique data set as the surveyors conducts both interviews and physical examination to produce their data.

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health` columns.

```{r nhanes-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ..., ...)
```

### 

The survey is run by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `age`.

```{r nhanes-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `hh_income`

```{r nhanes-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

The reason why we arranged the data twice is so that the second column is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age > 40, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income)
```

### Exercise 8

Continue the pipe with `gt()`

```{r nhanes-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

This created a basic table from our manipulated data



### Exercise 9

add a `title` and `subtitle` using the `tab_header()` function. Remember that to bold the title you need to use the `md()` function

```{r nhanes-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "**...**",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Continue the pipe to add labels for the columns. Use `col_label()` and change the labels for `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health`. 

```{r nhanes-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = ...,
             age = ...,
             sleep = ...,
             general_health = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

Continue the pipe to add a footnote (using `tab_footnote()`) which will indicate how `general_health` is ranked. assign the footnote to the `footnote` parameter, and assign the `cells_body()` function to location. Within `cells_body()` set the column to `general_health`. This adds the footnote to all the values within `general_health`.

```{r nhanes-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
To make quotation marks appear, add a "\" before the "
```

```{r nhanes-11-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "...",
               locations = cells_body(column = ...))
```

### 

The information added to the footnote was given when `?nhanes` was run



### Exercise 12

Continue the pipe to include the source of the data. use `tab_source_note()` and use  `md()` to italicize the source information.

```{r nhanes-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to italicize text using md() is adding `*` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*...*"))
```

### 

Congratulations, you should now have created a table that looks like this:

```{r}
nhanes_t
```

## regression tables
### 

**gtsummary** is a package that can be used to summarize data and tibbles and is useful in creating regression tables. A regression table shows how closely the relationship between independent variable(s) and a dependent variable is.

### Exercise 1

load in the **gtsummary** package.
```{r regression-tables-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(gtsummary)
```

### 

Let's create a regression table that looks like:

```{r}
m1 <- stan_glm(data = trains, formula = att_end ~ party, refresh = 0)

regression1_t <- tbl_regression(m1, 
               intercept = TRUE, 
               estimate_fun = function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2)) %>%
  as_gt() 

regression2_t <- regression1_t %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
             subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
regression2_t
```

### Exercise 2

I have creaed the model we will use to create the table and assigned it to `m1`.  run `m1` to view it.

```{r regression-tables-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
m1
```

### 

<!-- Reword this! Sounds weird. -->

Don't think too hard about how this was created or what the output means, you may learn more about this through post secondary education

The **rstanarm** package was used to create this object

**rstanarm** uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a programming language, for its estimation.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with the `tbl_regression()` function. Within `tbl_regression()` assign `m1` to `x`, `TRUE` to `intercept`, and `function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2))` to `estimate_fun`.

```{r regression-tables-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
tbl_regression(...)
```

### 

`estimate_fun` allows us to round and format the coefficient estimates provided by `tbl_regression()`

### 

The `function()` function allows us to define new functions.

The `style_sigfig()` function converts a numeric argument to a string that has been rounded to a significant figure-like number.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with `as_gt()`.

```{r regression-tables-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  as_gt()
```

### 

Currently you should have a simple table that looks like this:

```{r}
regression1_t
```

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe with `tab_header()` to add a suitable title and subtitle. 

```{r regression-tables-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  tab_header(...)
```

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe to add a caption using `tab_source_note`. To properly format the caption, wrap the character string in a call to md(). 

```{r regression-tables-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string 
```

```{r regression-tables-6-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
```

### 

Congrats! You should now have a completed table that looks like:

```{r}
regression2_t
```

## reactable
### 

**[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** is a package that allows us to create interactive tables.

### Exercise 1

Load the **[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** library.

```{r reactable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r reactable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be used to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/) this package. 

### Exercise 2

Run `reactable(trains)` to create a very simple table using the data found within the `trains` data set.

```{r reactable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
reactable(trains)

Now, let's create a table that looks like this. 

```{r}
#This palette was chosen since conservationism is associated with red, and liberalism with blue.
color1 <- paletteer_c("ggthemes::Red-Blue-White Diverging", 13)
# Function by Greg Lin
# Higher bias gives more widely spaced colors at the high end. Needs to be positive.
#These biases where chosen to ensure that half the scale is red in color, and half is blue
make_color_pal <- function(colors, bias = 1) 
                  {get_color <- colorRamp(colors, bias = bias)
                  function(x) rgb(get_color(x), maxColorValue = 255)}

att_change_pal <- make_color_pal(color1, bias = 1.35)

att_start_end_pal <- make_color_pal(color1, bias = 1.7)

ideology_change_pal <- make_color_pal(color1, bias = 0.8)

ideology_start_end_pal <- make_color_pal(color1, bias = 1.8)

att_change_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$att_end - trains$att_start)) /
                              (max(trains$att_end - trains$att_start) - 
                                   min(trains$att_end - trains$att_start))
                color <- att_change_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}

att_end_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$att_end)) /
                              (max(trains$att_end) - min(trains$att_end))
                color <- att_start_end_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}

att_start_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$att_start)) /
                              (max(trains$att_start) - min(trains$att_start))
                color <- att_start_end_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}

ideology_change_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$ideology_end - trains$ideology_start)) /
                              (max(trains$ideology_end - trains$ideology_start) - 
                               min(trains$ideology_end - trains$ideology_start))
                color <- ideology_change_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}

ideology_end_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$ideology_end)) /
                              (max(trains$ideology_end) - min(trains$ideology_end))
                color <- ideology_start_end_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}

ideology_start_color <- function(value) 
                {value
                normalized <- (value - min(trains$ideology_start)) /
                              (max(trains$ideology_start) - min(trains$ideology_start))
                color <- ideology_start_end_pal(normalized)
                list(background = color)}


reactable1_t <- trains %>%
  #These filters were chosen arbitrarily to keep the able small
  filter(treatment ==  "Control") %>%
  filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age >= 40) %>% 
  # I created these 2 columns because they would look cool in color
  mutate(ideology_change = ideology_end - ideology_start, att_change = att_end - att_start) %>% 
  select(gender, age, race, party, att_start, att_end, att_change, ideology_start, ideology_end, ideology_change) %>%
  reactable(pagination = FALSE,
            highlight = TRUE,
            compact = TRUE,
            outlined = TRUE,
            defaultColDef = colDef(align = "left"),
            columns = list(gender = colDef(name = "Gender"),
                           age = colDef(name = "Age"),
                           race = colDef(name = "Race"),
                           party = colDef(name = "Party"),
                           att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude",
                                              style = att_start_color),
                           att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude",
                                            style = att_end_color),
                           att_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude", 
                                               style = att_change_color),
                           ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology",
                                                   style = ideology_start_color),
                           ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology",
                                                 style = ideology_end_color),
                           ideology_change = colDef(name ="Change in Ideology",
                                                    style = ideology_change_color)))
reactable1_t
```

### 

Note that you can interact with this table!

### Exercise 3

To create this table, we will use the trains data set. run `?trains` to learn more about the data set

```{r reactable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains 
```

### 

Though there are 2 levels in `treatment`, we will only be making a table for the control group in this set of exercises.

### Exercise 4

Start a pipe with `trains`. Continue the pipe and `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `treatment == "Control"`, `gender == "Female"`, and `age >= 40`.

```{r reactable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  filter(..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe to `select()` the `gender`, `age`, `race`, `party`, `att_start`, `att_end`, `ideology_start`, and `ideology_end` columns.


```{r reactable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  select(...)
```

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `reactable()` to create a simple table.

```{r reactable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `reactable()` assign `FALSE` to `pagination`. This makes the table to display on one page.

```{r reactable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(pagination = ...)
```

### 

This is useful when your table only takes a few pages to display.

### Exercise 8

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `highlight`. This will highlight table rows on hover.

```{r reactable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., highlight = ...)
```

### 

Another method to make rows more distinguishable is by assigning `TRUE` to `striped` within `reactable()`. This will change the background of every other row.

### Exercise 9

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `compact`. This makes the table more compact.

```{r reactable-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., compact = ...)
```

### 

This is a good parameter to use if you want a minimalist table.

### Exercise 10

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `outlined`. This will add borders around the table.

```{r reactable-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., outlined = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

`defaultColDef` is a parameter within `reactable()` that allows us to define the default settings for each column within our table.

Within `reactable()`, assign `colDef(align = "left")` to `defaultColDef`. This will left-align all columns.


```{r reactable-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., defaultColDef = colDef(align = "left"))
```

### 

`colDef()` is a function that allows us to define what a column will look like in the table.

### Exercise 12

Set the value of the `columns` argument should be set to:

````
list(gender = colDef( name = "Gender"), 
     age = colDef(name = "Age"), 
     race = colDef(name = "Race"), 
     party = colDef(name = "Party"), 
     att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"), 
     att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"), 
     att_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude"), 
     ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology"), 
     ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology"),
     ideology_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude"))
````

This will rename the columns to more suitable names.



```{r reactable-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., columns = list(...))
```

### Exercise 13

Add color to the `att_start` column by assigning `att_start_color` to the style argument within the `colDef()` function for `att_start`.

```{r reactable-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., columns = list(...,
                                att_start = colDef(..., style = att_start_color),
                                ...))
```

### 

The functions to add color were created using the **paletteer** package

### 

You will need to repeat the same thing to add color to the `att_end`, `att_change`, `ideology_start`, `ideology_end`, and `ideology_change` columns.

### Exercise 14

Add color to the `att_end`, `att_change`, `ideology_start`, `ideology_end`, and `ideology_change` columns
by assigning `att_end_color`, `att_change_color`, `ideology_start_color`, `ideology_end_color`, and `ideology_change_color` to the style argument within the `colDef()` function for the respective columns.

```{r reactable-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., columns = list(..., 
     att_end = colDef(..., style = ...), 
     att_change = colDef(..., style = ...), 
     ideology_start = colDef(..., style = ...), 
     ideology_end = colDef(..., style = ...), 
     ideology_change = colDef(..., style = ...))
```

Congratulations!

You should have now created a table that looks like:

```{r}
reactable1_t 
```
